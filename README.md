# WTF is Forge??
This is an unofficial kickstart documentation of the famous Minecraft mod loader, *Minecraft Forge*, made by someone who knows absolutely nothing about it (but who is a good programmer).

Its purpose is to assist people who are already good at object oriented programming quickly get a feel for how modding works with Minecraft's and Forge's API work so that they don't have have to worry about figuring out the basics from scratch.
