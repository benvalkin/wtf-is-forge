This is an unofficial documentation of the famous Minecraft mod loader, Minecraft Forge, made by someone who knows absolutely nothing about it (but who is a good programmer). Its purpose is to assist people who are already good at object oriented programming learn how Minecraft and Forge's API work so that they can get into mod making.
